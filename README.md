# ActivePathways

**June 22 2023: ActivePathways version 2.0.0 is now available. This update provides additional functionality to p-value merging, allowing for directional information between datasets to be incorporated.**


ActivePathways is a tool for multivariate pathway enrichment analysis that identifies gene sets, such as pathways or Gene Ontology terms, that are over-represented in a list or matrix of genes. ActivePathways uses a data fusion method to combine multiple omics datasets, prioritizes genes based on the significance and direction of signals from the omics datasets, and performs pathway enrichment analysis of these prioritized genes. Using this strategy, we can find pathways and genes supported by single or multiple omics datasets, as well as additional genes and pathways that are only apparent through data integration and remain undetected in any single dataset alone. 



The first version of ActivePathways was published in Nature Communications with the PCAWG Pan-Cancer project.

## Using ActivePathways

See the vignette for more details. Run `browseVignettes(package='ActivePathways')` in R.


### Examples
The simplest use of ActivePathways requires only a data table and a GMT file. The data table is a matrix of p-values of genes/transcripts/proteins as rows and omics datasets as columns. it also needs a list of gene sets in the form of a GMT [(Gene Matrix Transposed)](https://software.broadinstitute.org/cancer/software/gsea/wiki/index.php/Data_formats#GMT:_Gene_Matrix_Transposed_file_format_.28.2A.gmt.29) file. 

* The data table must be a numerical matrix. For a single gene list, a one-column matrix can be used. The matrix cannot contain any missing values, and one conservative option is to re-assign all missing values as 1s, indicating our confidence that the missing P-values are always insignificant. Alternatively, one may consider removing genes with NA values.

* Gene sets in the form of a GMT file can be acquired from multiple [sources](https://baderlab.org/GeneSets) such as Gene Ontology, Reactome and others. For better accuracy and statistical power these pathway databases should be combined. Acquiring an [up-to-date GMT file](http://download.baderlab.org/EM_Genesets/current_release/) is essential to avoid using unreliable outdated annotations.

### Examples - Directional integration of multi-omics data

ActivePathways 2.0 extends our integrative pathway analysis framework significantly. We can now define expected directional assumptions of input omics datasets for more accurate analyses. This allows us to prioritise genes and pathways where certain directional assumptions are met, and penalise those where the assumptions are violated. 

For example, fold-change in protein expression would be expected to associate positively with mRNA fold-change of the corresponding gene, while negative associations would be unexpected and indicate more-complex situations or potential false positives. We can instruct the pathway analysis to prioritise positively-associated protein/mRNA pairs and penalise negative associations (or vice versa). 

Two additional inputs are included in ActivePathways that allow diverse multi-omics analyses. These inputs are optional. 

The scores_direction and expected_direction parameters are provided in the merge_p_values() and ActivePathways() functions to incorporate this directional penalty into the data fusion and pathway enrichment analyses. 

The parameter expected_direction is a vector that allows the user to represent the expected relationship between the input omics datasets. The vector size is n_datasets. Values include +1, -1, and 0. 

The parameter scores_direction is a matrix that reflects the directions that the genes/transcripts/protein show in the data. The matrix size is n_genes * n_datasets, that is the same size as the P-value matrix. This is a numeric matrix, but only the signs of the values are accounted for. 

#### Directional data integration at the gene level

```R 
pvals_FCs <- read.table(system.file('extdata', 'Differential_expression_rna_protein.tsv',

dir_matrix <- as.matrix(dir_matrix)
# ActivePathways will only use the signs of the direction values (ie +1 or -1).
dir_matrix <- sign(dir_matrix)
#

# This matrix has to be accompanied by a vector that provides the expected relationship between the

# Alternatively, we can use c(1,-1) to prioritise genes/proteins where directions are the opposite.
expected_direction <- c(1,1)

# Alternatively, we can use another vector to prioritise genes/proteins where the directions are the opposite.
# expected_direction <- c(1,-1)

# Now we merge the P-values of the two datasets using directional assumtions and compare these with the plain non-directional merging. 
# The top 5 scoring genes differ if we penalize genes where this directional logic is violated: While 4 of 5 genes retain significance, the gene PIK3R4 is penalized. 
# Interestingly, as a consequence of penalizing PIK3R4, other genes such as ITGB2 move up in rank.

```
To assess the impact of the directional penalty on gene merged P-value signals we create a plot showing directional results on the y axis and non-directional results on the x. Green dots are prioritized hits, red dots are penalized.

#### Pathway-level insight
To explore the impact of these gene-level changes on the biological pathways they influence, we compare our results with and without a directional penalty.

```R 
fname_GMT2 <- system.file("extdata", "hsapiens_REAC_subset2.gmt", package = "ActivePathways")

# Package default: no directionality
res_brown <- ActivePathways(scores3, merge_method = "Brown", gmt = fname_GMT2,cytoscape_file_tag = "Original_")

# Added feature: incorporating directionality
res_browndir <- ActivePathways(scores3, merge_method = "Brown", gmt = fname_GMT2, cytoscape_file_tag = "Directional_",
                               scores_direction = scores_direction, expected_direction = expected_direction)               
```
To compare the changes in biological pathways before and after incorporating directionality, we combine both outputs into a single enrichment map for [plotting](#visualizing-directional-impact-with-node-borders).

More thorough documentation of the ActivePathways function can be found in R with `?ActivePathways`, and complete tutorials can be found with `browseVignettes(package='ActivePathways')`.


# Visualising pathway enrichment results using enrichment maps in Cytoscape

The Cytoscape software and the EnrichmentMap app provide powerful tools to visualise the enriched pathways from `ActivePathways` as a network (i.e., an Enrichment Map). To facilitate this visualisation step, `ActivePathways` provides the files needed for building enrichment maps. To create these files, a file prefix must be supplied to `ActivePathways` using the argument `cytoscape_file_tag`. The prefix can be a path to an existing writable directory.
 
```{r}
res <- ActivePathways(scores, fname_GMT, cytoscape_file_tag = "enrichmentMap__")
```
Four files are written using the prefix:

* `enrichmentMap__pathways.txt` contains the table of significant terms (i.e. molecular pathways, biological processes, other gene sets) and the associated adjusted P-values. Note that only terms with `adjusted_p_val <= significant` are written.

* `enrichmentMap__subgroups.txt` contains a matrix indicating the columns of the input matrix of P-values that contributed to the discovery of the corresponding pathways. These values correspond to the `evidence` evaluation of input omics datasets discussed above, where a value of one indicates that the pathway was also detectable using a specific input omics dataset. A value of zero indicates otherwise. This file will be not generated if a single-column matrix of scores corresponding to just one omics dataset is provided to `ActivePathways`.

* `enrichmentMap__pathways.gmt` contains a shortened version of the supplied GMT file which consists of only the significant pathways detected by `ActivePathways`. 

* `enrichmentMap__legend.pdf` is a pdf file that displays a color legend of different omics datasets visualised in the enrichment map that can be used as a reference to the generated enrichment map.

## Creating enrichment maps using results of ActivePathways 

Pathway enrichment analysis often leads to complex and redundant results. Enrichment maps are network-based visualisations of pathway enrichment analyses. Enrichment maps can be generated in the Cytoscape software using the EnrichmentMap app. **The enhancedGraphics app is also required**. See the vignette for details: `browseVignettes(package='ActivePathways')`.


## Required software

1.	Cytoscape, see <https://cytoscape.org/download.html>
2.	EnrichmentMap app of Cytoscape, see menu Apps>App manager or <https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enrichmentmap> 
3.	EhancedGraphics app of Cytoscape, see menu Apps>App manager or <https://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/enhancedGraphics> 

## Creating the enrichment map

* Open the Cytoscape software. 
* Select *Apps -> EnrichmentMap*. 
* In the following dialogue, click the button `+` *Add Data Set from Files* in the top left corner of the dialogue.
* Change the Analysis Type to Generic/gProfiler/Enrichr.
* Upload the files `enrichmentMap__pathways.txt` and `enrichmentMap__pathways.gmt` in the *Enrichments* and *GMT* fields, respectively. 
* Click the checkbox *Show Advanced Options* and set *Cutoff* to 0.6.
* Then click *Build* in the bottom-right corner to create the enrichment map.

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/NetworkStep1_V2.png)


## Colour the nodes of the network to visualise supporting omics datasets

To color nodes in the network (i.e., molecular pathways, biological processes) according to the omics datasets supporting the enrichments, the third file `enrichmentMap__subgroups.txt` needs to be imported to Cytoscape directly. To import the file, activate the menu option *File -> Import -> Table from File* and select the file `enrichmentMap__subgroups.txt`. In the following dialogue, select *To a Network Collection* in the dropdown menu *Where to Import Table Data*. Click OK to proceed. 

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/ImportStep_V2.png)

Next, Cytoscape needs to use the imported information to color nodes using a pie chart visualisation. To enable this click the Style tab in the left control panel and select the Image/Chart1 Property in a series of dropdown menus (*Properties -> Paint -> Custom Paint 1 -> Image/Chart 1*). 

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/PropertiesDropDown2_V2.png)

The *image/Chart 1* property now appears in the Style control panel. Click the triangle on the right, then set the *Column* to *instruct* and the *Mapping Type* to *Passthrough Mapping*. 

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/StylePanel_V2.png)

This step colours the nodes corresponding to the enriched pathways according to the supporting omics datasets, based on the scores matrix initially analysed in `ActivePathways`. 

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/NetworkStep2_V2.png)

To allow better interpretation of the enrichment map, `ActivePathways` generates a color legend in the file `enrichmentMap__legend.pdf` that shows which colors correspond to which omics datasets. 

![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/LegendView.png)

Note that one of the colors corresponds to a subset of enriched pathways with *combined* evidence that were only detected through data fusion and P-value merging and not when any of the input datasets were detected separately. This exemplifies the added value of integrative multi-omics pathway enrichment analysis. 

## Visualizing directional impact with node borders

From the drop-down Properties menu, select *Border Line Type*.

<img src="https://github.com/MSlobody/APW2_tutorial/blob/main/border_line_type.jpg" width="500" />

Set *Column* to *directional impact* and *Mapping Type* to *Discrete Mapping*. To compare findings between a non-directional and a directional method, we highlight shared (0), lost (1), and gained (2) pathways between the approaches. Here, we have solid lines for the shared pathways, dots for the lost pathways, and vertical lines for the gained pathways. Border widths can be adjusted in the *Border Width* property, again with discrete mapping.

<img src="https://github.com/MSlobody/APW2_tutorial/blob/main/set_aesthetic.jpg" width="500"/>

This step changes node borders in the aggregated enrichment map, depicting the additional information provided by directional impact.

<img src="https://github.com/MSlobody/APW2_tutorial/blob/main/new_map.png" width="800" /> 
<img src="https://github.com/MSlobody/APW2_tutorial/blob/main/legend_sized.png" width="100" />

## Alternative node coloring

For a more diverse range of colors, ActivePathways supports any color palette from RColorBrewer. The color_palette parameter must be provided.
```{r}
res <- ActivePathways(scores, gmt_file, cytoscape_file_tag = "enrichmentMap__", color_palette = "Pastel1")
```
![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/LegendView_RColorBrewer.png)

Instead, to manually input the color of each dataset the custom_colors parameter must be specified as a vector. This vector should contain the same number of colors as columns
in the scores matrix.
```{r}
res <- ActivePathways(scores, gmt_file, cytoscape_file_tag = "enrichmentMap__", custom_colors = c("violet","green","orange","red"))
```
![](https://github.com/reimandlab/ActivePathways/blob/master/vignettes/LegendView_Custom.png)

To change the color of the *combined* contribution, a color must be provided to the color_integrated_only parameter.

Tip: if the coloring of nodes did not work in Cytoscape after setting the options in the Style panel, check that the EnhancedGraphics Cytoscape app is installed.
