\arguments{
\item{scores}{A numerical matrix of p-values where each row is a gene and
each column represents an omics dataset (evidence). Rownames correspond to the genes 
and colnames to the datasets. All values must be 0<=p<=1. We recommend converting 
missing values to ones.}

\item{gmt}{A GMT object to be used for enrichment analysis. If a filename, a
GMT object will be read from the file.}

\item{background}{A character vector of gene names to be used as a
statistical background. By default, the background is all genes that appear
in \code{gmt}.}

\item{geneset_filter}{A numeric vector of length two giving the lower and 
upper limits for the size of the annotated geneset to pathways in gmt.
Pathways with a geneset shorter than \code{geneset_filter[1]} or longer
than \code{geneset_filter[2]} will be removed. Set either value to NA
to not enforce a minimum or maximum value, or set \code{geneset_filter} to 
\code{NULL} to skip filtering.}

\item{cutoff}{A maximum merged p-value for a gene to be used for analysis.
Any genes with merged, unadjusted \code{p > significant} will be discarded 
before testing.}

\item{significant}{Significance cutoff for selecting enriched pathways. Pathways with
\code{adjusted_p_val <= significant} will be selected as results.}

\item{merge_method}{Statistical method to merge p-values. See section on Merging P-Values}

\item{correction_method}{Statistical method to correct p-values. See
\code{\link[stats]{p.adjust}} for details.}

\item{cytoscape_file_tag}{The directory and/or file prefix to which the output files
for generating enrichment maps should be written. If NA, files will not be written.}

\item{color_palette}{Color palette from RColorBrewer::brewer.pal to color each
column in the scores matrix. If NULL grDevices::rainbow is used by default.}

\item{custom_colors}{A character vector of custom colors for each column in the scores matrix.}

\item{color_integrated_only}{A character vector of length 1 specifying the color of the 
"combined" pathway contribution.}

\item{scores_direction}{A numerical matrix of log2 transformed fold-change values where each row is a
gene and each column represents a dataset (evidence). Rownames correspond to the genes
and colnames to the datasets. We recommend converting missing values to zero. 
Must contain the same dimensions as the scores parameter. Datasets without directional information should be set to 0.}

\item{constraints_vector}{A numerical vector of +1 or -1 values corresponding to the user-defined
directional relationship between columns in scores_direction. Datasets without directional information should
be set to 0.}
}
\value{
A data.table of terms (enriched pathways) containing the following columns:
  \describe{
    \item{term_id}{The database ID of the term}
    \item{term_name}{The full name of the term}
    \item{adjusted_p_val}{The associated p-value, adjusted for multiple testing}
    \item{term_size}{The number of genes annotated to the term}
    \item{overlap}{A character vector of the genes enriched in the term}
    \item{evidence}{Columns of \code{scores} (i.e., omics datasets) that contributed 
         individually to the enrichment of the term. Each input column is evaluated 
         separately for enrichments and added to the evidence if the term is found.}

\section{Merging P-values}{

To obtain a single p-value for each gene across the multiple omics datasets considered, 
the p-values in \code{scores} #' are merged row-wise using a data fusion approach of p-value merging. 
The four available methods are:
\describe{
 \item{Fisher}{Fisher's method assumes p-values are uniformly
 distributed and performs a chi-squared test on the statistic sum(-2 log(p)).
 This method is most appropriate when the columns in \code{scores} are
 independent.}
 \item{Brown}{Brown's method extends Fisher's method by accounting for the
 covariance in the columns of \code{scores}. It is more appropriate when the
 tests of significance used to create the columns in \code{scores} are not
 necessarily independent. The Brown's method is therefore recommended for 
 many omics integration approaches.}
 \item{Stouffer}{Stouffer's method assumes p-values are uniformly distributed
 and transforms p-values into a Z-score using the cumulative distribution function of a
 standard normal distribution. This method is appropriate when the columns in \code{scores}
  are independent.}
 \item{Strube}{Strube's method extends Stouffer's method by accounting for the 
 covariance in the columns of \code{scores}.}
}
}

\section{Cytoscape}{

  To visualize and interpret enriched pathways, ActivePathways provides an option
  to further analyse results as enrichment maps in the Cytoscape software. 
  If \code{!is.na(cytoscape_file_tag)}, four files will be written that can be used 
  to build enrichment maps. This requires the EnrichmentMap and enhancedGraphics apps.

The four files written are:
  \describe{
    \item{pathways.txt}{A list of significant terms and the
    associated p-value. Only terms with \code{adjusted_p_val <= significant} are
    written to this file.}
    \item{subgroups.txt}{A matrix indicating whether the significant terms (pathways)
    were also found to be significant when considering only one column from
    \code{scores}. A one indicates that term was found to be significant 
			when only p-values in that column were used to select genes.}
    \item{pathways.gmt}{A Shortened version of the supplied GMT
    file, containing only the significantly enriched terms in pathways.txt. }
    \item{legend.pdf}{A legend with colours matching contributions
    from columns in \code{scores}.}
  }

  How to use: Create an enrichment map in Cytoscape with the file of terms
  (pathways.txt) and the shortened gmt file
  (pathways.gmt). Upload the subgroups file (subgroups.txt) as a table
  using the menu File > Import > Table from File. To paint nodes according 
  to the type of supporting evidence, use the 'style'
  panel, set image/Chart1 to use the column `instruct` and the passthrough
  mapping type. Make sure the app enhancedGraphics is installed. 
  Lastly, use the file legend.pdf as a reference for colors in the enrichment map.
