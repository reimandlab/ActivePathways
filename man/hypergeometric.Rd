\title{Hypergeometric test}
\usage{
hypergeometric(counts)
}
\arguments{
\item{counts}{A 2x2 numerical matrix representing a contingency table.}
}
\value{
a p-value of enrichment of genes in a term or pathway.
}
\description{
Perform a hypergeometric test, also known as the Fisher's exact test, on a 2x2 contingency
table with the alternative hypothesis set to 'greater'. In this application, the test finds the
probability that counts[1, 1] or more genes would be found to be annotated to a term (pathway),
assuming the null hypothesis of genes being distributed randomly to terms.
